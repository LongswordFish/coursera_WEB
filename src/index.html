                <p>Probably all people know the mission of Apollo 11 and the famous <q>That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.</q> by Neil Armstrong.  However, not a lot of people are familiar with the mission of Apollo 17, the last time human beings landed on the Moon.</p>
                <p>What is there on the moon is probably one of the oldest questions of mankind. Humans could only guess through fantasy before, but in the 1960s, the United States decided to start exploring the moon, and the Apollo project was born. There are a total of 15 Apollo spacecrafts to implement the plan, of which, the last time it was Apollo 17.</p>

                <h3>launching</h3>
                <p>Apollo 17 was launched at the night of 07 Dec 1972, making it the only night launch in the whole Apollo series. Nearly 500,000 people around the world were estimated to have watched the streaming of this launch. Two days later, on December 10, the engine of <dfn><abbr title="command and service module">CSM</abbr></dfn> slowed down, bringing the <dfn><abbr title="command and service module">CSM</abbr></dfn> stack into lunar orbit.<sup>[1]</sup> </p>

                <h3>Moon landing</h3>
                <p>This time, the <dfn><abbr title="Lunar Module">LM</abbr></dfn> was built to separate with the <dfn><abbr title="command and service module">CSM</abbr></dfn>, and brought our crew, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, to and back from the Lunar, while Evans stayed at the <dfn><abbr title="command and service module">CSM</abbr></dfn> doing space experiments. After separating from the <dfn><abbr title="command and service module">CSM</abbr></dfn>, the crew began to descent for the landing to Taurus-Littrow. The <dfn><abbr title="Lunar Module">LM</abbr></dfn>landed on the lunar surface at 2:55 pm EST on December 11. </p>

                <h3>Lunar surface</h3>
                <p>Three moonwalks(EVAs) were scheduled in Apollo 17. The astronauts gathered 14 kilograms of samples, took seven gravimeter measurements, and deployed two explosive packages at their first EVA on 11th Dec<sup>[2]</sup>.  While at the second EVA on 12th Dec., the crew made a record of the longest-duration EVA in history to-date, which was seven hours and thirty-seven minutes. On their last EVA on 13th Dec., the astronauts gathered 66 kilograms of samples, and Gene Cernan made the famous expression: <q>... I'm on the surface; and, as I take man's last step from the surface, back home for some time to come - but we believe not too long into the future - I'd like to just [say] what I believe history will record. That America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. "Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17." <sup>[3]</sup></q></p>
                
                <h3>Return to Earth</h3>
                <p>The LM left the Lunar and reconnected to the <dfn><abbr title="command and service module">CSM</abbr></dfn> on December 14, and after 5 days of travelling, the Apollo 17 spacecraft successfully landed back on Earth on December 19.</p>

            <div>
                <p>One of the object for Apollo 17 was to bring back some rocks older or younger than the rocks the NASA already had from the earlier missions. That’s why the Taurus-Littrow area was picked as the landing site from this mission. The astronauts didn’t let the NASA down. They brought back 111kg rocks from the Moon.</p>
                <p>Also, Like Apollo 15 and Apollo 16, Apollo 17 was a "J-mission", meaning that the astronaunts would stay at the lunar for 3 days and use the Lunar Roving Vehicle.<sup>[4]</sup> </p>
                <p>There were other scientific objectives of the Apollo 17 mission like geological surveying and sampling of materials of the Taurus-Littrow region; deploying and activating surface experiments; and conducting in-flight experiments and photographic tasks during lunar orbit and transearth coast<sup>[5]</sup>. </p>

                <p>During lunar surface operations, Commander Cernan always drove the rover, while Lunar Module Pilot Schmitt was a passenger who assisted with navigation<sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
                <p>Harrison H. Schmitt  remains the only professional scientist to have flown beyond low Earth orbit and to have visited the Moon<sup>[7]</sup>.</p>
                <p>As the name might suggest, Mr Cernan is of Czechoslovak descent. Indeed, he carried Czechoslovakia’s flag with him on his final space flight.<sup>[8]</sup></p>
